# TextbookBreeze
A nice and simple template for a PDF textbook viewer that views sections at a time. Written in PHP.

## Setup
**You must know PHP in order to get TextbookBreeze working. TextbookBreeze is not a "plug-in-and-go" application,
but rather a template for PDF-based online textbook viewers.**

Simply edit the file "tbb.php" to adjust the program to your liking. Please note that changing the file name of "tbb.php" will break the existing code.
